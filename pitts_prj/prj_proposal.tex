\indent This project will analyze how a Markov chain Monte 
Carlo technique can be implemented in reinforcement learning. 
This underlying Bayesian technique will enable an algorithm 
to make decisions based off of state changes and probability 
ratios.  I am fascinated by algorithms being able to learn 
based on the actions taken. This project is inspired by my 
summer REU project. Although that project was categorized as 
statistics, I argue that the Bayesian procedure that we 
developed is a reinforcement learning algorithm.  I, however, 
do not want to steal or copy any of that work and will 
instead take a broader look into how a Bayesian procedure 
aided by a Markov chain Monte Carlo can be used in a 
reinforcement algorithm. \\
\indent My goal with this theoretical project is to look 
at the math behind the algorithms and the potential 
applications this reinforcement learning approach has.  
Below are some academic sources I have gathered.
